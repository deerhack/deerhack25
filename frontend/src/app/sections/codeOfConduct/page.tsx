      <h2 className={`text-3xl text-secondary ${cabinetExtraBold.className} mb-5`}>Why Code of Conduct?</h2>
          <p className="mb-10">
            Nepal&apos;s developer community is constantly developing. We see it
            as our duty to do everything in our power to foster a welcoming and
            secure atmosphere for hackathons and the community at large. We want
            to expand the spaces where people who are otherwise discriminated
            against, harassed, or intimidated can feel safe and secure.
            Hackathons, in our opinion, may advance not just technology but also
            culture. This Code of Conduct exists not merely for its own sake but
            also as a testament to our continued dedication to resolving the
            aforementioned problems.
          </p>

          <h2 className={`text-3xl ${cabinetExtraBold.className} text-secondary mb-5`}>Applicability</h2>
          <p className="mb-10">
            All participants, sponsors, and other stakeholders in DeerHack, as
            well as any projects created here, are subject to this Code of
            Conduct.
          </p>

          <h2 className={`text-3xl text-secondary ${cabinetExtraBold.className} mb-5`}>The Short Version</h2>
          <p className="mb-10">
            DeerHack is dedicated to providing an inclusive hackathon
            environment for all participants, regardless of gender, gender
            identity, and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability,
            physical appearance, body size, color, ethnicity, religion (or lack
            thereof), or technological preferences. Any form of harassment of
            our participants is not acceptable. At DeerHack, profane language
            and imagery included in presentations during workshops and/or in
            internet media are not acceptable. Participants who violate these
            rules may be sanctioned or dismissed from the event. We are
            committed to providing a welcoming and encouraging developer
            community. Participants from all walks of life are welcome, and we
            respect each and every one of them.
          </p>

          <h2 className={`text-3xl text-secondary ${cabinetExtraBold.className} mb-5`}>No Plagiarism or Re-Use of Past Work </h2>
          <p className="mb-10">
            Only projects developed during DeerHack will be considered. However,
            you must disclose the extent of the prior use with your submission
            if you desire to submit projects that contain previously used code
            or re-submit a project that you previously submitted to another
            hackathon. If it is discovered during an inspection that the project
            has reused code that was not disclosed with the submission, the
            organizer may ask the participant to describe the connections and
            differences between the old and new work, or they may disqualify the
            submission from receiving awards on its own merits.
          </p>
